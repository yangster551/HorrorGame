Chapter 3: DOLL

timeskip
June 22 1999 (3 weeks later)

She's dead. Your daughter is dead. 
After 3 weeks of police and neighbors searching day and night, there were no signs of her body.
Only thing left from that day was the DOLL.

(examineDoll)
A smile is plastered on its face.
Her face is dirtied with mud.
Short dark hair roughly chopped at the ends.
Pure white skin, almost resembling a ghost.
Glassy brown eyes...like she was crying? 

placeDoll
You place the doll on your bedstand.
She’s in a sitting position with her hands by her side
Staring blankly at the bedroom wall. 

“Type ‘sleep’ to continue” #action

You wake up. #Timed response 
“Where’s is she?”

checkKitchen
You walk into the kitchen, warm light shines on your face. 
But where’s the doll?

Doll acts weird
Moves around the house
Hear laughter
Hear doll calling for mother
Violent
Facial expression change

Chapter 4: DOLL HOUSE
Slowly turning into a doll
Joints start to hurt 
Body hurts
migraines
Hair starts falling out
Catching herself staring at something for long periods of time
Always smiling even when she’s not happy. 
Doll smiles even more somehow X_X



Chapter 5: END
Mother turned into doll
smile plastered on face
daughter in front of her smiling as well
Both look in the mirror staring at themselves
Mirror cracks / shatters
